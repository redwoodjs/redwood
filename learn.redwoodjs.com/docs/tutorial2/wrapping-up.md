You made it! Again! In Part 1 of the tutorial we learned about a lot of features that make it easier to create functionality for your users—cells, forms, scaffolding, and more. In Part 2 we learned more about the features that make life easier for us, the developers: Storybook and testing.

Testing is like wearing a seat belt: 99% of the time may not see any direct benefits, but that other 1% of the time you're *really* glad you were wearing it. The first time your build stops and prevents some production-crashing bug from going live you'll know that all those hours you spent writing tests were worth it. Getting into the habit of writing tests along with your user-facing code is the greatest gift you can give your future developer self (that, and writing good comments!).

Will there be a Part 3 of the tutorial? It's a fact that the best things come in threes: Lord of the Rings movies, sides of a triangle, and Super Mario Bros. games on the NES. We've spent a lot of time getting our features working but not much time with optimization and polish. [Premature optimization is the root of all evil](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization), but once your site is live and you've got real users on it you'll get a sense of what could be faster, prettier or more efficient. That's when time spent optimizing can pay huge dividends. But, discovering the techniques and best practices for those optimizations...that's a whole different story. The kind of story that Redwood loves to help you write!

So until next time, a bit of wisdom to help combat that next bout of every developer's nemesis, imposter syndrome:

### What's Next

Want to add some more features to your app? Check out some of our Cookbook recipes like [calling to a third party API](https://redwoodjs.com/cookbook/using-a-third-party-api) and [deploying an app without an API at all](https://redwoodjs.com/cookbook/disable-api-database). We've also got lots of [guides](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction) for more info on Redwood's internals.

### Roadmap

Check out our [Roadmap](https://redwoodjs.com/roadmap) to see where we're headed and how we're going to get there. If you're interested in helping with anything you see, just let us know over on the [RedwoodJS Forum](https://community.redwoodjs.com/) and we'll be happy to get you set up. The release candidate for 1.0 is now available, with GA release expected in the first half of 2022!
