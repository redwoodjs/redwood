# When a PR is merged into the main branch, this workflow tries to cherry pick the squashed commit into the next branch
# by fast forwarding the next branch via the `--ff` option.
# If that doesn't work (i.e. main and next have diverged), it'll open a PR against the next branch with the squashed commit.
