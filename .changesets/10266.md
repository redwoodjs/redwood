- chore(linting): Update versions and avoid `{}` (#10266) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This PR updates the versions of the `eslint` and the `@typescript-eslint` packages from v5 to v7. 

This is a major upgrade of the `@typescript-eslint` package and although we think it is unlikely to introduce a breaking change for you we would recommend that you read the associated documentation. The v6 upgrade can be found [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v6/) and the v7 one [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v7/).
