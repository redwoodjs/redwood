- Middleware Routing & `registerMiddleware` (#10395) by @dac09

Implements the new syntax of using Middleware after discussion. This sets us up for doing Auth better, but also for implementations like OG Image generation. 

```js
export const registerMiddleware = async () => {
	return [
		dbAuthMiddleware(),
		[new OgMiddleware({ rootFilename: 'index' }), [ '/:route.:extension']]
	]
}
```

**Features**
- [x] Registering middleware with above syntax
- [x] Chaining multiple middleware by passing array of middleware, or tuples
- [x] Defining the route patterns to match in the find-my-way syntax

--- 
**What syntax are you using for the route patterns?**
After discussion that Regexes are slow and unwieldy, I did some research and comparisons here: https://www.notion.so/redwoodjs/Middleware-Route-patterns-0f1c5587b4134073adfae896a782b5ea?pvs=

This implementation uses https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way - which is the Fastify version - but still keeps us decoupled from Fastify (see implementation, or document for why).

**Important for understanding**
Quoting from find-my-way docs:
> The nodes are matched in the following order:
    static
    parametric node with static ending
    parametric(regex)/multi-parametric
    parametric
    wildcard

Which means, if you have a more specific one - example you have `[mw1, `*`]` and `[mw2, '/refresh_auth']` - then a request to /refresh_auth will ONLY trigger mw2. This is sort of counter intuitive, but them are the rules with fmw.
