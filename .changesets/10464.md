- fix(router): Remove barrel exports from router.tsx (#10464) by @Tobbe

We were using both `index.ts` and `router.tsx` as barrel export files. We should move away from barrel exports at some point, and we definitely don't need two files doing it in the same package. Everything that was exported from `router.tsx` is already exported by other files (except `Router` itself). So I updated the code to import from there directly instead.

This is a breaking change for anyone who does `import ... from '@redwoodjs/router/dist/router'` in their project. Which hopefully isn't very many.

 - The quick fix is to find the original export and pull from there instead
 - The real fix is to talk to us on the core team and see if we can provide an
   official way of solving it instead of relying on internal implementation
   details 🙂
