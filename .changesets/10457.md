- feat(server-auth): dbAuth 3/3 -  handle login, logout, signup, etc. requests if forwarded from middleware (#10457) by @dac09

This PR updates the DbAuthHandler class to handle requests forwarded from middleware, so it can generate responses for login, logout, signup, etc. These are POST requests - it used to be to the `/auth` function, but now they will be captured by dbAuth middleware and forwarded onto DbAuthHandler. 

**High level changes:**
- use the `Headers` class in each of the "method" responses. This allows us to set multi-value headers like Set-Cookie. A simple object would not. See type `AuthMethodOutput`
- extracts `buildResponse` into a testable function and adds test. For `Set-Cookie` headers we return an array of strings. 

In the middleware here's the code I had for the final conversion:
```ts
    if (AUTHHANDLER_REQUEST) {
      const output = await dbAuthHandler(req)

      const finalHeaders = new Headers()
      Object.entries(output.headers).forEach(([key, value]) => {
        if (Array.isArray(value)) {
          value.forEach((v) => finalHeaders.append(key, v))
        } else {
          finalHeaders.append(key, value)
        }
      })

      return new MiddlewareResponse(output.body, {
        headers: finalHeaders,
        status: output.statusCode,
      })
    }
```
