- feat(server-auth): WebAuthN support during SSR (#10498) by @dac09

**This PR changes the following:**
**1. Moves webAuthN imports to be dynamic imports**
This is because the dbauth-provider-web packages are still CJS only. When importing in an ESM environment (such as SSR/RSC server) - it complains that about ESM imports

**2. Updates the default auth provider state for middleware auth**
Middleware auth default state is _almost_ the same as SPA default auth state. Except that loading is always false! Otherwise you can get stuck in a loading state forever.
