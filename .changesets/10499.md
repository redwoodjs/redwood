- feat(auth): Implement Supabase Auth Middleware (#10499) by @dthyresson, @dac09

Implement Supabase Auth Middleware to authenticate server-side requests.

* Adds middleware to the Supabase auth-providers package.
* createSupabaseAuthMiddleware is responsible for authenticating Supabase requests
* It does so by checking if the request has a supabase auth-provider header, and then uses the authDecoder to verify the session cookie using the Supabase ServerAuthClient and returning a decoded access token -- or throwing an exception if the session cookie is invalid
* Once the middleware has the decoded JWT, it hands that to the provided getCurrentUser from he user's project to return the information about authenticated user
* Lastly, it sets serverAuthState with user and metadata info to know the request isAuthenticated
* If the session is invalid or the cookie tampered with such that the access token cannot be verified, serverAuthState is cleared as are the auth provider and Supabase cookies
