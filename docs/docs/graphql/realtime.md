# GraphQL Realtime

In GraphQL, there are two options for real-time updates: **live queries** and **subscriptions**.

Subscriptions are part of the GraphQL specification, whereas live queries are not.

There are times where subscriptions are well-suited for a realtime problem — and in some cases live queries may be a better fit. Later we’ll explore the pros and cons of each approach and how best to decide which to use and when.

See [subscriptions and live queries](../realtime.md#subscriptions-and-live-queries) for setup and usages.
