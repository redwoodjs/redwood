# GraphQL

GraphQL is a fundamental part of Redwood. Having said that, you can get going without knowing anything about it, and can actually get quite far without ever having to read [the docs](https://graphql.org/learn/). But to master Redwood, you'll need to have more than just a vague notion of what GraphQL is. You'll have to really grok it.


## GraphQL 101

GraphQL is a query language that enhances the exchange of data between clients (in Redwood's case, a React app) and servers (a Redwood API).

Unlike a REST API, a GraphQL Client performs operations that allow gathering a rich dataset in a single request.
There's three types of GraphQL operations, but here we'll only focus on two: Queries (to read data) and Mutations (to create, update, or delete data).

The following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetProject {
  project(name: "GraphQL") {
    id
    title
    description
    owner {
      id
      username
    }
    tags {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

returns the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "project": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "My Project",
      "description": "Lorem ipsum...",
      "owner": {
        "id": 11,
        "username": "Redwood",
      },
      "tags": [
        { "id": 22, "name": "graphql" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "errors": null
}
```

Notice that the response's structure mirrors the query's. In this way, GraphQL makes fetching data descriptive and predictable.

Again, unlike a REST API, a GraphQL API is built on a schema that specifies exactly which queries and mutations can be performed.
For the `GetProject` query above, here's the schema backing it:

```graphql
type Project {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  description: String
  owner: User!
  tags: [Tag]
}

# ... User and Tag type definitions

type Query {
  project(name: String!): Project
}
```

:::info

More information on GraphQL types can be found in the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

:::

Finally, the GraphQL schema is associated with a resolvers map that helps resolve each requested field. For example, here's what the resolver for the owner field on the Project type may look like:

```ts
export const Project = {
  owner: (args, { root, context, info }) => {
    return db.project.findUnique({ where: { id: root.id } }).user()
  },
  // ...
}
```

:::info

You can read more about resolvers in the dedicated [Understanding Default Resolvers](#understanding-default-resolvers) section below.

:::

To summarize, when a GraphQL query reaches a GraphQL API, here's what happens:

```
+--------------------+                  +--------------------+
|                    | 1.send operation |                    |
|                    |                  |   GraphQL Server   |
|   GraphQL Client   +----------------->|    |               |
|                    |                  |    |  2.resolve    |
|                    |                  |    |     data      |

          |                             | |                | |
          |                             | +--------+-------+ |
          |  3. respond JSON with data  |          |         |
          +-----------------------------+ <--------+         |
                                        |                    |
                                        +--------------------+
```

In contrast to most GraphQL implementations, Redwood provides a "deconstructed" way of creating a GraphQL API:

- You define your SDLs (schema) in `*.sdl.js` files, which define what queries and mutations are available, and what fields can be returned
- For each query or mutation, you write a service function with the same name. This is the resolver
- Redwood then takes all your SDLs and Services (resolvers), combines them into a GraphQL server, and expose it as an endpoint

## RedwoodJS and GraphQL

Besides taking care of the annoying stuff for you (namely, mapping your resolvers, which gets annoying fast if you do it yourself!), there's not many gotchas with GraphQL in Redwood.
The only Redwood-specific thing you should really be aware of is [resolver args](#redwoods-resolver-args).

Since there's two parts to GraphQL in Redwood, the client and the server, we've divided this doc up that way.

On the `web` side, Redwood uses [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) by default though you can swap it out for something else if you want.


The `api` side offers a GraphQL server built on [GraphQL Yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com) and the [Envelop plugin system](https://www.envelop.dev/docs) from [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev).
###

Redwood's api side is "serverless first", meaning it's architected as functions which can be deployed on either serverless or traditional infrastructure, and Redwood's GraphQL endpoint is effectively "just another function" (with a whole lot more going on under the hood, but that part is handled for you, out of the box).
One of the tenets of the Redwood philosophy is "Redwood believes that, as much as possible, you should be able to operate in a serverless mindset and deploy to a generic computational grid.”

### GraphQL Yoga and the Generic Computation Grid

To be able to deploy to a “generic computation grid” means that, as a developer, you should be able to deploy using the provider or technology of your choosing. You should be able to deploy to Netlify, Vercel, Fly, Render, AWS Serverless, or elsewhere with ease and no vendor or platform lock in. You should be in control of the framework, what the response looks like, and how your clients consume it.

The same should be true of your GraphQL Server. [GraphQL Yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com) from [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) makes that possible.

> The fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance and great developer experience.

RedwoodJS leverages Yoga's Envelop plugins to implement custom internal plugins to help with [authentication](#authentication), [logging](#logging), [directive handling](#directives), and more.
### Security Best Practices


RedwoodJS implements GraphQL Armor from [Escape Technologies](https://escape.tech) to make your endpoint more secure by default by implementing common GraphQL [security best practices](#security).

GraphQL Armor, developed by Escape in partnership with The Guild, is a middleware for JS servers that adds a security layer to the RedwoodJS GraphQL endpoint.

### Conclusion

All this gets us closer to Redwood's goal of being able to deploy to a "generic computation grid". And that’s exciting!

## Client-side

### RedwoodApolloProvider

By default, Redwood Apps come ready-to-query with the `RedwoodApolloProvider`. As you can tell from the name, this Provider wraps [ApolloProvider](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#the-apolloprovider-component). Omitting a few things, this is what you'll normally see in Redwood Apps:

```jsx title="web/src/App.js"
import { RedwoodApolloProvider } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

// ...

const App = () => (
  <RedwoodApolloProvider>
    <Routes />
  </RedwoodApolloProvider>
)

// ...
```

You can use Apollo's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks by importing them from `@redwoodjs/web`, though if you're using `useQuery`, we recommend that you use a [Cell](cells.md):

```jsx title="web/src/components/MutateButton.js"
import { useMutation } from '@redwoodjs/web'

const MUTATION = gql`
  # your mutation...
`

const MutateButton = () => {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => mutate({ ... })}>
      Click to mutate
    </button>
  )
}
```

Note that you're free to use any of Apollo's other hooks, you'll just have to import them from `@apollo/client` instead. In particular, these two hooks might come in handy:

| Hook                                                                                         | Description                                                          |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [useLazyQuery](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#uselazyquery)       | Execute queries in response to events other than component rendering |
| [useApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#useapolloclient) | Access your instance of `ApolloClient`                               |

### Customizing the Apollo Client and Cache

By default, `RedwoodApolloProvider` configures an `ApolloClient` instance with 1) a default instance of `InMemoryCache` to cache responses from the GraphQL API and 2) an `authMiddleware` to sign API requests for use with [Redwood's built-in auth](authentication.md). Beyond the `cache` and `link` params, which are used to set up that functionality, you can specify additional params to be passed to `ApolloClient` using the `graphQLClientConfig` prop. The full list of available configuration options for the client are [documented here on Apollo's site](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#options).

Depending on your use case, you may want to configure `InMemoryCache`. For example, you may need to specify a type policy to change the key by which a model is cached or to enable pagination on a query. [This article from Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/) explains in further detail why and how you might want to do this.

To configure the cache when it's created, use the `cacheConfig` property on `graphQLClientConfig`. Any value you pass is passed directly to `InMemoryCache` when it's created.

For example, if you have a query named `search` that supports [Apollo's offset pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/core-api/), you could enable it by specifying:

```jsx
<RedwoodApolloProvider graphQLClientConfig={{
  cacheConfig: {
    typePolicies: {
      Query: {
        fields: {
          search: {
            // Uses the offsetLimitPagination preset from "@apollo/client/utilities";
            ...offsetLimitPagination()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}}>
```

### Generate Possible Types


In order to use [fragments](#fragments) with [unions](#unions) and interfaces in Apollo Client, you need to tell the client how to discriminate between the different types that implement or belong to a supertype.

You pass a possibleTypes option to the InMemoryCache constructor to specify these relationships in your schema.

This object maps the name of an interface or union type (the supertype) to the types that implement or belong to it (the subtypes).

For example:

```ts
/// web/src/App.tsx

<RedwoodApolloProvider graphQLClientConfig={{
  cacheConfig: {
    possibleTypes: {
      Character: ["Jedi", "Droid"],
      Test: ["PassingTest", "FailingTest", "SkippedTest"],
      Snake: ["Viper", "Python"],
      Groceries: ['Fruit', 'Vegetable'],
    },
  },
}}>
```

To make this easier to maintain, RedwoodJS GraphQL CodeGen automatically generates `possibleTypes` so you can simply assign it to the `graphQLClientConfig`:


```ts
import possibleTypes from 'src/graphql/possibleTypes'

...
/// web/src/App.tsx
<RedwoodApolloProvider
  graphQLClientConfig={{
    cacheConfig: {
      ...possibleTypes,
    },
  }}
>
```

### Swapping out the RedwoodApolloProvider

As long as you're willing to do a bit of configuring yourself, you can swap out `RedwoodApolloProvider` with your GraphQL Client of choice. You'll just have to get to know a bit of the make up of the [RedwoodApolloProvider](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/web/src/apollo/index.tsx#L71-L84); it's actually composed of a few more Providers and hooks:

- `FetchConfigProvider`
- `useFetchConfig`
- `GraphQLHooksProvider`

For an example of configuring your own GraphQL Client, see the [redwoodjs-react-query-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redwoodjs-react-query-provider). If you were thinking about using [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), you can also just go ahead and install it!

Note that if you don't import `RedwoodApolloProvider`, it won't be included in your bundle, dropping your bundle size quite a lot!

## Server-side

### Understanding Default Resolvers

According to the spec, for every field in your sdl, there has to be a resolver in your Services. But you'll usually see fewer resolvers in your Services than you technically should. And that's because if you don't define a resolver, GraphQL Yoga server will.

The key question the Yoga server asks is: "Does the parent argument (in Redwood apps, the `parent` argument is named `root`&mdash;see [Redwood's Resolver Args](#redwoods-resolver-args)) have a property with this resolver's exact name?" Most of the time, especially with Prisma Client's ergonomic returns, the answer is yes.

Let's walk through an example. Say our sdl looks like this:

```jsx title="api/src/graphql/user.sdl.js"
export const schema = gql`
  type User {
    id: Int!
    email: String!
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    users: [User!]!
  }
`
```

So we have a User model in our `schema.prisma` that looks like this:

```jsx
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

If you create your Services for this model using Redwood's generator (`yarn rw g service user`), your Services will look like this:

```jsx title="api/src/services/user/user.js"
import { db } from 'src/lib/db'

export const users = () => {
  return db.user.findMany()
}
```

Which begs the question: where are the resolvers for the User fields&mdash;`id`, `email`, and `name`?
All we have is the resolver for the Query field, `users`.

As we just mentioned, GraphQL Yoga defines them for you. And since the `root` argument for `id`, `email`, and `name` has a property with each resolvers' exact name (i.e. `root.id`, `root.email`, `root.name`), it'll return the property's value (instead of returning `undefined`, which is what Yoga would do if that weren't the case).

But, if you wanted to be explicit about it, this is what it would look like:

```jsx title="api/src/services/user/user.js"
import { db } from 'src/lib/db'

export const users = () => {
  return db.user.findMany()
}

export const Users = {
  id: (_args, { root }) => root.id,
  email: (_args, { root }) => root.email,
  name: (_args, { root }) => root.name,
}
```

The terminological way of saying this is, to create a resolver for a field on a type, in the Service, export an object with the same name as the type that has a property with the same name as the field.

Sometimes you want to do this since you can do things like add completely custom fields this way:

```jsx {5}
export const Users = {
  id: (_args, { root }) => root.id,
  email: (_args, { root }) => root.email,
  name: (_args, { root }) => root.name,
  age: (_args, { root }) => new Date().getFullYear() - root.birthDate.getFullYear()
}
```

### Redwood's Resolver Args

[According to the spec](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers), resolvers take four arguments: `args`, `obj`, `context`, and `info`. In Redwood, resolvers do take these four arguments, but what they're named and how they're passed to resolvers is slightly different:

- `args` is passed as the first argument
- `obj` is named `root` (all the rest keep their names)
- `root`, `context`, and `info` are wrapped into an object, `gqlArgs`; this object is passed as the second argument

Here's an example to make things clear:

```js
export const Post = {
  user: (args, gqlArgs) => db.post.findUnique({ where: { id: gqlArgs?.root.id } }).user(),
}
```

Of the four, you'll see `args` and `root` being used a lot.

| Argument  | Description                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `args`    | The arguments provided to the field in the GraphQL query                                     |
| `root`    | The previous return in the resolver chain                                                    |
| `context` | Holds important contextual information, like the currently logged in user                    |
| `info`    | Holds field-specific information relevant to the current query as well as the schema details |

> **There's so many terms!**
>
> Half the battle here is really just coming to terms. To keep your head from spinning, keep in mind that everybody tends to rename `obj` to something else: Redwood calls it `root`, GraphQL Yoga calls it `parent`. `obj` isn't exactly the most descriptive name in the world.

### Context

In Redwood, the `context` object that's passed to resolvers is actually available to all your Services, whether or not they're serving as resolvers. Just import it from `@redwoodjs/graphql-server`:

```jsx
import { context } from '@redwoodjs/graphql-server'
```

#### How to Modify the Context

Because the context is read-only in your services, if you need to modify it, then you need to do so in the `createGraphQLHandler`.

To populate or enrich the context on a per-request basis with additional attributes, set the `context` attribute `createGraphQLHandler` to a custom ContextFunction that modifies the context.

For example, if we want to populate a new, custom `ipAddress` attribute on the context with the information from the request's event, declare the `setIpAddress` ContextFunction as seen here:

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.js"
// ...

const ipAddress = ({ event }) => {
  return event?.headers?.['client-ip'] || event?.requestContext?.identity?.sourceIp || 'localhost'
}

const setIpAddress = async ({ event, context }) => {
  context.ipAddress = ipAddress({ event })
}

export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  getCurrentUser,
  loggerConfig: {
    logger,
    options: { operationName: true, tracing: true },
  },
  schema: makeMergedSchema({
    schemas,
    services,
  }),
  context: setIpAddress,
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

> **Note:** If you use the preview GraphQL Yoga/Envelop `graphql-server` package and a custom ContextFunction to modify the context in the createGraphQL handler, the function is provided **_only the context_** and **_not the event_**. However, the `event` information is available as an attribute of the context as `context.event`. Therefore, in the above example, one would fetch the ip address from the event this way: `ipAddress({ event: context.event })`.

### The Root Schema

Did you know that you can query `redwood`? Try it in the GraphQL Playground (you can find the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:8911/graphql when your dev server is running&mdash;`yarn rw dev api`):

```graphql
query {
  redwood {
    version
    currentUser
  }
}
```

How is this possible? Via Redwood's [root schema](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/graphql-server/src/rootSchema.ts). The root schema is where things like currentUser are defined:

```graphql
  scalar BigInt
  scalar Date
  scalar Time
  scalar DateTime
  scalar JSON
  scalar JSONObject

  type Redwood {
    version: String
    currentUser: JSON
    prismaVersion: String
  }

  type Query {
    redwood: Redwood
  }
```

Now that you've seen the sdl, be sure to check out [the resolvers](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/graphql-server/src/rootSchema.ts):

```ts
export const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  BigInt: BigIntResolver,
  Date: DateResolver,
  Time: TimeResolver,
  DateTime: DateTimeResolver,
  JSON: JSONResolver,
  JSONObject: JSONObjectResolver,
  Query: {
    redwood: () => ({
      version: redwoodVersion,
      prismaVersion: prismaVersion,
      currentUser: (_args: any, context: GlobalContext) => {
        return context?.currentUser
      },
    }),
  },
}
```

<!-- ### The query workflow

The GraphQL Playground's nice, but if you're a power user, you'll want to be using something a little more dedicated and always on; where you can save things like environments...

## CORS Configuration

CORS stands for [Cross Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing); in a nutshell, by default, browsers aren't allowed to access resources outside their own domain.

Let's say you're hosting each of your Redwood app's sides on different domains: the web side on `www.example.com` and the api side (and thus, the GraphQL Server) on `api.example.com`.
When the browser tries to fetch data from the `/graphql` function, you'll see an error that says the request was blocked due to CORS. Wording may vary, but it'll be similar to:

> ⛔️ Access to fetch ... has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

To fix this, you need to "configure CORS" by adding:

```
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://example.com'
'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': true
```

to the GraphQL response headers which you can do this by setting the `cors` option in `api/src/functions/graphql.{js|t}s`:

```tsx
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  cors: {
    // 👈 setup your CORS configuration options
    origin: '*',
    credentials: true,
  },
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

For more in-depth discussion and configuration of CORS when it comes to using a cookie-based auth system (like [dbAuth](authentication.md#self-hosted-auth-installation-and-setup)), see the [CORS documentation](cors.md).

## Health Checks

You can use health checks to determine if a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.
For example, services like [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com) use health checks to determine server uptime and will notify you if it becomes unavailable.

Redwood's GraphQL server provides a health check endpoint at `/graphql/health` as part of its GraphQL handler.
If the server is healthy and can accept requests, the response will contain the following headers:

```
content-type: application/json
server: GraphQL Yoga
x-yoga-id: yoga
```

and will return a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` status with the body:

```json
{
  "message": "alive"
}
```

Note the `x-yoga-id` header. The header's value defaults to `yoga` when `healthCheckId` isn't set in `createGraphQLHandler`. But you can customize it when configuring your GraphQL handler:

```ts title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...

export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  // This will be the value of the `x-yoga-id` header
  // highlight-next-line
  healthCheckId: 'my-redwood-graphql-server',
  getCurrentUser,
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

If the health check fails, then the GraphQL server is unavailable and you should investigate what could be causing the downtime.

#### Perform a Health Check

To perform a health check, make a HTTP GET request to the `/graphql/health` endpoint.

For local development,
with the proxy using `curl` from the command line:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/graphql/health" -i
```

or by directly invoking the graphql function:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8911/graphql/health" -i
```

you should get the response:

```json
{
  "message": "alive"
}
```

For production, make a request wherever your `/graphql` function exists.

> These examples use `curl` but you can perform a health check via any HTTP GET request.

#### Perform a Readiness Check

A readiness check confirms that your GraphQL server can accept requests and serve **your server's** traffic.

It forwards a request to the health check with a header that must match your `healthCheckId` in order to succeed.
If the `healthCheckId` doesn't match or the request fails, then your GraphQL server isn't "ready".

To perform a readiness check, make a HTTP GET request to the `/graphql/readiness` endpoint with the appropriate `healthCheckId` header.
For local development, you can make a request to the proxy:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/graphql/readiness" \
     -H 'x-yoga-id: yoga' \
     -i
```

or directly invoke the graphql function:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8911/graphql/readiness" \
     -H 'x-yoga-id: yoga' \
     -i
```

Either way, you should get a `200 OK` HTTP status if ready, or a `503 Service Unavailable` if not.

For production, make a request wherever your `/graphql` function exists.

> These examples use `curl` but you can perform a readiness check via any HTTP GET request with the proper headers.

## Verifying GraphQL Schema

In order to keep your GraphQL endpoint and services secure, you must specify one of `@requireAuth`, `@skipAuth` or a custom directive on **every** query and mutation defined in your SDL.

Redwood will verify that your schema complies with these runs when:

- building (or building just the api)
- launching the dev server.

If any fail this check, you will see:

- each query of mutation listed in the command's error log
- a fatal error `⚠️ GraphQL server crashed` if launching the server

### Build-time Verification

When building via the `yarn rw build` command and the SDL fails verification, you will see output that lists each query or mutation missing the directive:

```bash
  ✔ Generating Prisma Client...
  ✖ Verifying graphql schema...
    → - deletePost Mutation
    Building API...
    Cleaning Web...
    Building Web...
    Prerendering Web...

You must specify one of @requireAuth, @skipAuth or a custom directive for
- contacts Query
- posts Query
- post Query
- createContact Mutation
- createPost Mutation
- updatePost Mutation
- deletePost Mutation
```

### Dev Server Verification

When launching the dev server via the `yarn rw dev` command, you will see output that lists each query or mutation missing the directive:

```bash

gen | Generating TypeScript definitions and GraphQL schemas...
gen | 37 files generated
api | Building... Took 444 ms
api | Starting API Server... Took 2 ms
api | Listening on http://localhost:8911/
api | Importing Server Functions...
web | ...
api | FATAL [2021-09-24 18:41:49.700 +0000]:
api |  ⚠️ GraphQL server crashed
api |
api |     Error: You must specify one of @requireAuth, @skipAuth or a custom directive for
api |     - contacts Query
api |     - posts Query
api |     - post Query
api |     - createContact Mutation
api |     - createPost Mutation
api |     - updatePost Mutation
api |     - deletePost Mutation
```

To fix these errors, simple declare with `@requireAuth` to enforce authentication or `@skipAuth` to keep the operation public on each as appropriate for your app's permissions needs.

## Custom Scalars

GraphQL scalar types give data meaning and validate that their values makes sense. Out of the box, GraphQL comes with `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean` and `ID`. While those can cover a wide variety of use cases, you may need more specific scalar types to better describe and validate your application's data.

For example, if there's a `Person` type in your schema that has a field like `ageInYears`, if it's actually supposed to represent a person's age, technically it should only be a positive integer—never a negative one.
Something like the [`PositiveInt` scalar](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/positive-int) provides that meaning and validation.

### Scalars vs Service vs Directives

How are custom scalars different from Service Validations or Validator Directives?

[Service validations](services.md#service-validations) run when resolving the service. Because they run at the start of your Service function and throw if conditions aren't met, they're great for validating whenever you use a Service—anywhere, anytime.
For example, they'll validate via GraphQL, Serverless Functions, webhooks, etc. Custom scalars, however, only validate via GraphQL and not anywhere else.

Service validations also perform more fine-grained checks than scalars which are more geared toward validating that data is of a specific **type**.

[Validator Directives](#directives) control user **access** to data and also whether or not a user is authorized to perform certain queries and/or mutations.

### How To Add a Custom Scalar

Let's say that you have a `Product` type that has three fields: a name, a description, and the type of currency.
The built-in `String` scalar should suffice for the first two, but for the third, you'd be better off with a more-specific `String` scalar that only accepts [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency codes, like `USD`, `EUR`, `CAD`, etc.
Luckily there's already a [`Currency` scalar type](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-scalars/blob/master/src/scalars/Currency.ts) that does exactly that!
All you have to do is add it to your GraphQL schema.

To add a custom scalar to your GraphQL schema:

1. Add the scalar definition to one of your sdl files, such as `api/src/graphql/scalars.sdl.ts`

> Note that you may have to create this file. Moreover, it's just a convention—custom scalar type definitions can be in any of your sdl files.

```jsx title="api/src/graphql/scalars.sdl.ts"
export const schema = gql`
  scalar Currency
`
```

<br />

2. Import the scalar's definition and resolver and pass them to your GraphQLHandler via the `schemaOptions` property:

```tsx {10-13} title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
import { CurrencyDefinition, CurrencyResolver } from 'graphql-scalars'

// ...

export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  schemaOptions: {
    typeDefs: [CurrencyDefinition],
    resolvers: { Currency: CurrencyResolver },
  },
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

<br />

3. Use the scalar in your types

```tsx {6,18,24}
export const schema = gql`
  type Product {
    id: Int!
    name: String!
    description: String!
    currency_iso_4217: Currency! // validate on query
    createdAt: DateTime!
  }

  type Query {
    products: [Product!]! @requireAuth
    product(id: Int!): Product @requireAuth
  }

  input CreateProductInput {
    name: String!
    description: String!
    currency_iso_4217: Currency! // validate on mutation
  }

  input UpdateProductInput {
    name: String
    description: String
    currency_iso_4217: Currency // validate on mutation
  }

  type Mutation {
    createProduct(input: CreateProductInput!): Product! @requireAuth
    updateProduct(id: Int!, input: UpdateProductInput!): Product! @requireAuth
    deleteProduct(id: Int!): Product! @requireAuth
  }
`
```

## Directives

Directives supercharge your GraphQL services. They add configuration to fields, types or operations that act like "middleware" that lets you run reusable code during GraphQL execution to perform tasks like [authentication](#authentication), formatting, and more.

You'll recognize a directive by its preceded by the `@` character, e.g. `@myDirective`, and by being declared alongside a field:

```tsx
type Bar {
  name: String! @myDirective
}
```

or a Query or Mutation:

```tsx
type Query {
  bars: [Bar!]! @myDirective
}

type Mutation {
  createBar(input: CreateBarInput!): Bar! @myDirective
}
```

See the [Directives](directives) section for complete information on RedwoodJS Directives.

## Fragments

[GraphQL fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) are reusable units of GraphQL queries that allow developers to define a set of fields that can be included in multiple queries. Fragments help improve code organization, reduce duplication, and make GraphQL queries more maintainable. They are particularly useful when you want to request the same set of fields on different parts of your data model or when you want to share query structures across multiple components or pages in your application.

### What are Fragments?

Here are some key points about GraphQL fragments:

1. **Reusability**: Fragments allow you to define a set of fields once and reuse them in multiple queries. This reduces redundancy and makes your code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

2. **Readability**: Fragments make queries more readable by separating the query structure from the actual query usage. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

3. **Maintainability**: When you need to make changes to the requested fields, you only need to update the fragment definition in one place, and all queries using that fragment will automatically reflect the changes.

### Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how you might use GraphQL fragments in developer documentation:

Let's say you have a GraphQL schema representing books, and you want to create a fragment for retrieving basic book information like title, author, and publication year.


```graphql
# Define a GraphQL fragment for book information
fragment BookInfo on Book {
  id
  title
  author
  publicationYear
}

# Example query using the BookInfo fragment
query GetBookDetails($bookId: ID!) {
  book(id: $bookId) {
    ...BookInfo
    description
    # Include other fields specific to this query
  }
}
```

In this example:

- We've defined a fragment called `BookInfo` that specifies the fields we want for book information.
- In the `GetBookDetails` query, we use the `...BookInfo` spread syntax to include the fields defined in the fragment.
- We also include additional fields specific to this query, such as `description`.

By using the `BookInfo` fragment, you can maintain a consistent set of fields for book information across different parts of your application without duplicating the field selection in every query. This improves code maintainability and reduces the chance of errors.

In developer documentation, you can explain the purpose of the fragment, provide examples like the one above, and encourage developers to use fragments to organize and reuse their GraphQL queries effectively.

### Using Fragments in RedwoodJS

RedwoodJS makes it easy to use fragments, especially with VS Code and Apollo GraphQL Client.

First, RedwoodJS instructs the VS Code GraphQL Plugin where to look for fragments by configuring the `documents` attribute of your project's `graphql.config.js`:

```js
// graphql.config.js

const { getPaths } = require('@redwoodjs/internal')

module.exports = {
  schema: getPaths().generated.schema,
  documents: './web/src/**/!(*.d).{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', // 👈 Tells VS Code plugin where to find fragments
}
```

Second, RedwoodJS automatically creates the [fragmentRegistry](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#registering-named-fragments-using-createfragmentregistry) needed for Apollo to know about the fragments in your project without needing to interpolate their declarations.

Redwood exports ways to interact with fragments in the `@redwoodjs/web/apollo` package.

```
import { fragmentRegistry, registerFragment } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'
```

With `fragmentRegistry`, you can interact with the registry directly.

With `registerFragment`, you can register a fragment with the registry and get back:

 ```ts
 { fragment, typename, getCacheKey, useRegisteredFragment }
 ```

which can then be used to work with the registered fragment.

### registerFragment

To register a fragment, you can simply register it with `registerFragment`.

```ts
import { registerFragment } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

registerFragment(
  gql`
    fragment BookInfo on Book {
      id
      title
      author
      publicationYear
    }
  `
)
```

This makes the `BookInfo` available to use in your query:


```ts
import type { GetBookDetails } from 'types/graphql'

import { useQuery } from '@redwoodjs/web'

import BookInfo from 'src/components/BookInfo'

const GET_BOOK_DETAILS = gql`
  query GetBookDetails($bookId: ID!) {
    book(id: $bookId) {
      ...BookInfo
      description
      # Include other fields specific to this query
    }
  }

...

const { data, loading} = useQuery<GetBookDetails>(GET_BOOK_DETAILS)

```


You can then access the book info from `data` and render:

```ts
{!loading  && (
  <div key={`book-id-${id}`}>
    <h3>Title: {data.title}</h3>
    <p>by {data.author} ({data.publicationYear})<>
  </div>
)}
```

### fragment

Access the original fragment you registered.

```ts
import { fragment } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'
```

### typename

Access typename of fragment you registered.


```ts
import { typename } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'
```

For example, with

```graphql
# Define a GraphQL fragment for book information
fragment BookInfo on Book {
  id
  title
  author
  publicationYear
}

the `typename` is `Book`.


### useCache!!!

### getCacheKey

A helper function to create the cache key for the data associated with the fragment in Apollo cache.

```ts
import { getCacheKey } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'
```

For example, with

```graphql
# Define a GraphQL fragment for book information
fragment BookInfo on Book {
  id
  title
  author
  publicationYear
}
```

the `getCacheKey` is a function where `getCacheKey(42)` would return `Book:42`.

### useRegisteredFragment

```ts
import { registerFragment } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const { useRegisteredFragment } = registerFragment(
...
)
```

A helper function relies on Apollo's [`useFragment` hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#usefragment) in Apollo cache.

The useFragment hook represents a lightweight live binding into the Apollo Client Cache. It enables Apollo Client to broadcast specific fragment results to individual components. This hook returns an always-up-to-date view of whatever data the cache currently contains for a given fragment. useFragment never triggers network requests of its own.


This means that once the Apollo Client Cache has loaded the data needed for the fragment, one can simply render the data for the fragment component with its id reference.

Also, anywhere the fragment component is rendered will be updated with teh latest data if any of `useQuery` with uses the fragment received new data.

```ts
import type { Book } from 'types/graphql'

import { registerFragment } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const { useRegisteredFragment } = registerFragment(
  gql`
    fragment BookInfo on Book {
      id
      title
      author
      publicationYear
    }
  `
)

const Book = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const { data, complete } = useRegisteredFragment<Book>(id)

  return (
    complete && (
      <div key={`book-id-${id}`}>
        <h3>Title: {data.title}</h3>
        <p>by {data.author} ({data.publicationYear})<>
      </div>
    )
  )
}

export default Book
```

:::note
In order to use [fragments](#fragments) with [unions](#unions) and interfaces in Apollo Client, you need to tell the client how to discriminate between the different types that implement or belong to a supertype.

Please see how to [generate possible types from fragments and union types](#generate-possible-types).
:::

## Unions

Unions are abstract GraphQL types that enable a schema field to return one of multiple object types.

`union FavoriteTree = Redwood | Ginkgo | Oak`

A field can have a union as its return type.

```tsx
type Query {
  searchTrees: [FavoriteTree] // This list can include Redwood, Gingko or Oak objects
}
```

All of a union's included types must be object types and do not need to share any fields.

To query a union, you can take advantage on [inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments) to include subfields of multiple possible types.

```tsx
query GetFavoriteTrees {
  __typename // typename is helpful when querying a field that returns one of multiple types
  searchTrees {
    ... on Redwood {
      name
      height
    }
    ... on Ginkgo {
      name
      medicalUse
    }
    ... on Oak {
      name
      acornType
    }
  }
}
```

Redwood will automatically detect your union types in your `sdl` files and resolve *which* of your union's types is being returned. If the returned object does not match any of the valid types, the associated operation will produce a GraphQL error.

:::note

In order to use Union types web-side with your Apollo GraphQL client, you will need to [generate possible types from fragments and union types](#generate-possible-types).

:::

### useCache

Apollo Client stores the results of your GraphQL queries in a local, normalized, in-memory cache. This enables the client to respond almost immediately to queries for already-cached data, without even sending a network request.

useCache is a custom hook that returns the cache object and some useful methods to interact with the cache:

* [evict](#evict)
* [extract](#extract)
* [identify](#identify)
* [modify](#modify)
* [resetStore](#resetStore)
* [clearStore](#clearStore)

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'
```

#### cache

Returns the normalized, in-memory cache.

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const { cache } = useCache()
```

#### evict

Either removes a normalized object from the cache or removes a specific field from a normalized object in the cache.

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'


const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { evict } = useCache()
  const { data: fruit, complete } = useRegisteredFragment<Fruit>(id)

  evict(fruit)
}
```

#### extract

Returns a serialized representation of the cache's current contents

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { extract } = useCache()

  // Logs the cache's current contents
  console.log(extract())

```

#### identify

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { identify } = useCache()
  const { data: fruit, complete } = useRegisteredFragment<Fruit>(id)

  // Returns "Fruit:ownpc6co8a1w5bhfmavecko9"
  console.log(identify(fruit))
}
```

#### modify

Modifies one or more field values of a cached object. Must provide a modifier function for each field to modify. A modifier function takes a cached field's current value and returns the value that should replace it.

Returns true if the cache was modified successfully and false otherwise.

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { modify } = useCache()
  const { data: fruit, complete } = useRegisteredFragment<Fruit>(id)

  // Modify the name of a given fruit entity to be uppercase

  <button onClick={() => modify(fruit,  {
    name(cachedName) {
      return cachedName.toUpperCase()
  }})}>
    Uppercase {fruit.name}
  </button>

  // ...
}
```

#### clearStore

To reset the cache without refetching active queries, use the clearStore method.


```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { clearStore } = useCache()

  clearStore()
}
```

#### resetStore

Reset the cache entirely, such as when a user logs out.

```ts
import { useCache } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

const Fruit = ({ id }: { id: FragmentIdentifier }) => {
  const { resetStore } = useCache()

  resetStore()
}
```

## GraphQL Handler Setup

Redwood's `GraphQLHandlerOptions` allows you to configure your GraphQL handler schema, context, authentication, security and more.

```ts
export interface GraphQLHandlerOptions {
  /**
   * @description The identifier used in the GraphQL health check response.
   * It verifies readiness when sent as a header in the readiness check request.

```

### Directive Setup

Redwood makes it easy to code, organize, and map your directives into the GraphQL schema.

You simply add them to the `directives` directory and the `createGraphQLHandler` will do all the work.

```tsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
import { createGraphQLHandler } from '@redwoodjs/graphql-server'

import directives from 'src/directives/**/*.{js,ts}' // 👈 directives live here
import sdls from 'src/graphql/**/*.sdl.{js,ts}'
import services from 'src/services/**/*.{js,ts}'

import { db } from 'src/lib/db'
import { logger } from 'src/lib/logger'

export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  armorConfig, //  👈 custom GraphQL Security configuration
  directives, //  👈 directives are added to the schema here
  sdls,
  services,
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

> Note: Check-out the [in-depth look at Redwood Directives](directives) that explains how to generate directives so you may use them to validate access and transform the response.


### Logging Setup

For a details on setting up GraphQL Logging, see [Logging](#logging).
### Security Setup

For a details on setting up GraphQL Security, see [Security](#security).
## Logging

Logging is essential in production apps to be alerted about critical errors and to be able to respond effectively to support issues. In staging and development environments, logging helps you debug queries, resolvers and cell requests.

We want to make logging simple when using RedwoodJS and therefore have configured the api-side GraphQL handler to log common information about your queries and mutations. Log statements also be optionally enriched with [operation names](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name), user agents, request ids, and performance timings to give you more visibility into your GraphQL api.

By configuring the GraphQL handler to use your api side [RedwoodJS logger](logger), any errors and other log statements about the [GraphQL execution](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/) will be logged to the [destination](logger#destination-aka-where-to-log) you've set up: to standard output, file, or transport stream.

You configure the logger using the `loggerConfig` that accepts a [`logger`](logger) and a set of [GraphQL Logger Options](#graphql-logger-options).

### Configure the GraphQL Logger

A typical GraphQLHandler `graphql.ts` is as follows:

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...

import { logger } from 'src/lib/logger'

// ...
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  // ...
})
```

#### Log Common Information

The `loggerConfig` takes several options that logs meaningful information along the graphQL execution lifecycle.

| operationName | Include operation name. The operation name is a meaningful and explicit name for your operation. It is only required in multi-operation documents, but its use is encouraged because it is very helpful for debugging and server-side logging. When something goes wrong (you see errors either in your network logs, or in the logs of your GraphQL server) it is easier to identify a query in your codebase by name instead of trying to decipher the contents. Think of this just like a function name in your favorite programming language. See https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name |
| requestId     | Include the event's requestId, or if none, generate a uuid as an identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| query         | Include the query. This is the query or mutation (with fields) made in the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| tracing       | Include the tracing and timing information. This will log various performance timings within the GraphQL event lifecycle (parsing, validating, executing, etc).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| userAgent     | Include the browser (or client's) user agent. This can be helpful to know what type of client made the request to resolve issues when encountering errors or unexpected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Therefore, if you wish to log the GraphQL `query` made, the `data` returned, and the `operationName` used, you would

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: {
    logger,
    options: { data: true, operationName: true, query: true },
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Exclude Operations

You can exclude GraphQL operations by name with `excludeOperations`.
This is useful when you want to filter out certain operations from the log output, for example, `IntrospectionQuery` from GraphQL playground:

```jsx {5} title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: {
    logger,
    options: { excludeOperations: ['IntrospectionQuery'] },
  },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

> **Relevant anatomy of an operation**
>
> In the example below, `"FilteredQuery"` is the operation's name.
> That's what you'd pass to `excludeOperations` if you wanted it filtered out.
>
> ```js
> export const filteredQuery = `
>   query FilteredQuery {
>     me {
>       id
>       name
>     }
>   }
> ```

### Benefits of Logging

Benefits of logging common GraphQL request information include debugging, profiling, and resolving issue reports.

#### Operation Name Identifies Cells

The [operation name](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name) is a meaningful and explicit name for your operation. It is only required in multi-operation documents, but its use is encouraged because it is very helpful for debugging and server-side logging.

Because your cell typically has a unique operation name, logging this can help you identify which cell made a request.

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: { operationName: true } },
// ...
```

#### RequestId for Support Issue Resolution

Often times, your deployment provider will provide a request identifier to help reconcile and track down problems at an infrastructure level. For example, AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda (used by Netlify, for example) provides `requestId` on the `event`.

You can include the request identifier setting the `requestId` logger option to `true`.

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: { requestId: true } },
// ...
```

And then, when working to resolve a support issue with your deployment provider, you can supply this request id to help them track down and investigate the problem more easily.

#### No Need to Log within Services

By configuring your GraphQL logger to include `data` and `query` information about each request you can keep your service implementation clean, concise and free of repeated logger statements in every resolver -- and still log the useful debugging information.

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: { data: true, operationName: true, query: true } },
// ...

// api/src/services/posts.js
//...
export const post = async ({ id }) => {
  return await db.post.findUnique({
    where: { id },
  })
}
//...
```

The GraphQL handler will then take care of logging your query and data -- as long as your logger is setup to log at the `info` [level](logger#log-level) and above.

> You can also disable the statements in production by just logging at the `warn` [level](logger#log-level) or above

This means that you can keep your services free of logger statements, but still see what's happening!

```bash

#### Send to Third-party Transports

Stream to third-party log and application monitoring services vital to production logging in serverless environments like [logFlare](https://logflare.app/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) or [LogDNA](https://www.logdna.com/)

#### Supports Log Redaction

Everyone has heard of reports that Company X logged emails, or passwords to files or systems that may not have been secured. While RedwoodJS logging won't necessarily prevent that, it does provide you with the mechanism to ensure that won't happen.

To redact sensitive information, you can supply paths to keys that hold sensitive data using the RedwoodJS logger [redact option](logger#redaction).

Because this logger is used with the GraphQL handler, it will respect any redaction paths setup.

For example, you have chosen to log `data` return by each request, then you may want to redact sensitive information, like email addresses from your logs.

Here is an example of an application `/api/src/lib/logger.ts` configured to redact email addresses. Take note of the path `data.users[*].email` as this says, in the `data` attribute, redact the `email` from every `user`:

```jsx title="/api/src/lib/logger.ts"
import { createLogger, redactionsList } from '@redwoodjs/api/logger'

export const logger = createLogger({
  options: {
    redact: [...redactionsList, 'email', 'data.users[*].email'],
  },
})
```

#### Timing Traces and Metrics

Often you want to measure and report how long your queries take to execute and respond. You may already be measuring these durations at the database level, but you can also measure the time it takes for your the GraphQL server to parse, validate, and execute the request.

You may turn on logging these metrics via the `tracing` GraphQL configuration option.

```jsx title="api/src/functions/graphql.ts"
// ...
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: { tracing: true } },
// ...
```

Let's say we wanted to get some benchmark numbers for the "find post by id" resolver

```jsx
return await db.post.findUnique({
  where: { id },
})
```

We see that this request took about 500 msecs (note: duration is reported in nanoseconds).

For more details about the information logged and its format, see [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing).

```bash
pi | INFO [2021-07-09 14:25:52.452 +0000] (graphql-server): GraphQL willSendResponse
api |     tracing: {

api |           },
api |           {
api |             "path": [
api |               "post",
api |               "id"
api |             ],
api |             "parentType": "Post",
api |             "fieldName": "id",
api |             "returnType": "Int!",
api |             "startOffset": 520982888,

api |           },
... more paths follow ...
api |         ]
api |       }
api |     }
```

By logging the operation name and extracting the duration for each query, you can easily collect and benchmark query performance.

## Security

Parsing a GraphQL operation document is a very expensive and compute intensive operation that blocks the JavaScript event loop. If an attacker sends a very complex operation document with slight variations over and over again he can easily degrade the performance of the GraphQL server.

RedwoodJS will by default reject a variety malicious operation documents; that is, it'll prevent attackers from making malicious queries or mutations.

RedwoodJS is configured out-of-the-box with GraphQL security best practices:

* Schema Directive-based Authentication including RBAC validation
* Production Deploys disable Introspection and GraphQL Playground automatically
* Reject Malicious Operation Documents (Max Aliases, Max Cost, Max Depth, Max Directives, Max Tokens)
* Prevent Information Leaks (Block Field Suggestions, Mask Errors)

And with the Yoga Envelop Plugin ecosystem available to you, there are options for:

* CSRF Protection
* Rate Limiting
* and more.

### Authentication

By default, your GraphQL endpoint is open to the world.

That means anyone can request any query and invoke any Mutation.
Whatever types and fields are defined in your SDL is data that anyone can access.

Redwood [encourages being secure by default](directives) by defaulting all queries and mutations to have the `@requireAuth` directive when generating SDL or a service.

When your app builds and your server starts up, Redwood checks that **all** queries and mutations have `@requireAuth`, `@skipAuth` or a custom directive applied.

If not, then your build will fail:

```bash
  ✖ Verifying graphql schema...
    Building API...
    Cleaning Web...
    Building Web...
    Prerendering Web...
You must specify one of @requireAuth, @skipAuth or a custom directive for
- contacts Query
- posts Query
- post Query
- updatePost Mutation
- deletePost Mutation
```

or your server won't startup and you should see that "Schema validation failed":

```bash
gen | Generating TypeScript definitions and GraphQL schemas...
gen | 47 files generated
api | Building... Took 593 ms
api | [GQL Server Error] - Schema validation failed
api | ----------------------------------------
api | You must specify one of @requireAuth, @skipAuth or a custom directive for
api | - posts Query
api | - createPost Mutation
api | - updatePost Mutation
api | - deletePost Mutation
```

To correct, just add the appropriate directive to your queries and mutations.

If not, then your build will fail and your server won't startup.

#### @requireAuth

To enforce authentication, simply add the `@requireAuth` directive in your GraphQL schema for any query or field you want protected.

It's your responsibility to implement the `requireAuth()` function in your app's `api/src/lib/auth.{js|ts}` to check if the user is properly authenticated and/or has the expected role membership.

The `@requireAuth` directive will call the `requireAuth()` function to determine if the user is authenticated or not.

Here we enforce that a user must be logged in to `create`. `update` or `delete` a `Post`.

```ts
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  authorId: Int!
  author: User!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

input CreatePostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
  authorId: Int!
}

input UpdatePostInput {
  title: String
  body: String
  authorId: Int
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post! @requireAuth
  updatePost(id: Int!, input: UpdatePostInput!): Post! @requireAuth
  deletePost(id: Int!): Post! @requireAuth
}
```

It's your responsibility to implement the `requireAuth()` function in your app's `api/src/lib/auth.{js|ts}` to check if the user is properly authenticated and/or has the expected role membership.

The `@requireAuth` directive will call the requireAuth() function to determine if the user is authenticated or not.

```ts title="api/src/lib/auth.ts"
// ...

export const isAuthenticated = (): boolean => {
  return true // 👈 replace with the appropriate check
}

// ...

export const requireAuth = ({ roles }: { roles: AllowedRoles }) => {
  if (isAuthenticated()) {
    throw new AuthenticationError("You don't have permission to do that.")
  }

  if (!hasRole({ roles })) {
    throw new ForbiddenError("You don't have access to do that.")
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The `auth.ts` file here is the stub for a new RedwoodJS app. Once you have setup auth with your provider, this will enforce a proper authentication check.

##### Field-level Auth

You can apply the `@requireAuth` to any field as well (not just queries or mutations):

```ts
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String! @requireAuth
  authorId: Int!
  author: User!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}
```

##### Role-based Access Control

The `@requireAuth` directive lets you define roles that are permitted to perform the operation:

```ts
type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post! @requireAuth(roles: ['AUTHOR', 'EDITOR'])
  updatePost(id: Int!, input: UpdatePostInput!): Post! @requireAuth(roles: ['EDITOR']
  deletePost(id: Int!): Post! @requireAuth(roles: ['ADMIN']
}
```

#### @skipAuth

If, however, you want your query or mutation to be public, then simply use `@skipAuth`.

In the example, fetching all posts or a single post is allowed for all users, authenticated or not.

```ts
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  authorId: Int!
  author: User!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post!]! @skipAuth
  post(id: Int!): Post @skipAuth
}
```

### Introspection and Playground Disabled in Production

Because it is often useful to ask a GraphQL schema for information about what queries it supports, GraphQL allows us to do so using the [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) system.

The [GraphQL Playground](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/features/graphiql) is a way for you to interact with your schema and try out queries and mutations. It can show you the schema by inspecting it. You can find the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:8911/graphql when your dev server is running.

> Because both introspection and the playground share possibly sensitive information about your data model, your data, your queries and mutations, best practices for deploying a GraphQL Server call to disable these in production, RedwoodJS **, by default, only enables introspection and the playground when running in development**. That is when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`.

However, there may be cases where you want to enable introspection as well as the GraphQL PLaygrouns. You can enable introspection by setting the `allowIntrospection` option to `true` and enable GraphiQL by setting `allowGraphiQL` to `true`.

Here is an example of `createGraphQLHandler` function with the `allowIntrospection` and `allowGraphiQL` options set to `true`:
```ts {8}
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  authDecoder,
  getCurrentUser,
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  allowIntrospection: true, // 👈 enable introspection in all environments
  allowGraphiQL: true, // 👈 enable GraphiQL Playground in all environments
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

:::caution

Enabling introspection in production may pose a security risk, as it allows users to access information about your schema, queries, and mutations. Use this option with caution and make sure to secure your GraphQL API properly.

The may be cases where one wants to allow introspection, but not GraphiQL.

Or, you may want to enable GraphiQL, but not allow introspection; for example, to try out known queries, but not to share the entire set of possible operations and types.

### GraphQL Armor Configuration

[GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/) is a middleware that adds a security layer the RedwoodJS GraphQL endpoint configured with sensible defaults.

You don't have to configure anything to enforce protection against alias, cost, depth, directive, tokens abuse in GraphQL operations as well as to block field suggestions or revealing error messages that might leak sensitive information.

But, if you need to enable, disable to modify the default settings, GraphQL Armor is fully configurable in a per-plugin fashion.

Simply define and provide a custom GraphQL Security configuration to your `createGraphQLHandler`:

```ts
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  authDecoder,
  getCurrentUser,
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  armorConfig, //  👈 custom GraphQL Security configuration
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

For example, the default max query depth limit is 6. To change that setting to 2 levels, simply provide the configuration to your handler:

```ts
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  authDecoder,
  getCurrentUser,
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  armorConfig: { maxDepth: { n: 2 } },
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

#### Max Aliases

This protection is enabled by default.

Limit the number of aliases in a document. Defaults to 15.

##### Example

Aliases allow you to rename the data that is returned in a query’s results. They manipulate the structure of the query result that is fetched from your service, displaying it according to your web component's needs.

This contrived example uses 11 alias to rename a Post's id and title to various permutations of post, article, and blog to return a different shape in the query result as `articles`:

```ts
 {
  articles: posts {
    id
    articleId: id
    postId: id
    articlePostId: id
    postArticleId: id
    blogId: id
    title
    articleTitle: title
    postTitle: title
    articlePostTitle: title
    postArticleTitle: title
    blogTitle: title
  }
}
```

##### Configuration and Defaults

Limit the number of aliases in a document. Defaults to 15.

You can change the default value via the `maxAliases` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.

```ts
{
  maxAliases: {
    enabled: true,
    n: 15,
  }
}
```
#### Cost Limit

This protection is enabled by default.

It analyzes incoming GraphQL queries and applies a cost analysis algorithm to prevent resource overload by blocking too expensive requests (DoS attack attempts).

The cost computation is quite simple (and naive) at the moment but there are plans to make it evolve toward a extensive plugin with many features.

Defaults to a overall maxCost limit of 5000.

##### Overview

Cost is a factor of the kind of field and depth. Total Cost is a cumulative sum of each field based on its type and its depth in the query.

Scalar fields -- those that return values like strings or numbers -- are worth one value; whereas are objects are worth another.

How deep they are nested in the query is a multiplier factor such that:

```
COST = FIELD_KIND_COST * (DEPTH * DEPTH_COST_FACTOR)
TOTAL_COST = SUM(COST)
```

If the `TOTAL_COST` exceeds the `maxCost`, an error stops GraphQL execution and rejects the request.

You have control over the field kind and depth costs settings, but the defaults are:

```
objectCost: 2, // cost of retrieving an object
scalarCost: 1, // cost of retrieving a scalar
depthCostFactor: 1.5, // multiplicative cost of depth
```

##### Example

In this small example, we have one object field `me` that contains two, nested scalar fields `id` and `me`. There is an operation `profile` (which is neither a scalar nor object and thus ignored as part of the cost calculation).

```ts
{
  profile {
    me {
      id
      user
    }
  }
}
```
The cost breakdown for cost is:

* two scalars `id` and `user` worth 1 each
* they are at level 1 depth with a depth factor of 1.5
* 2 \* ( 1 \* 1.5 ) = 2 \* 1.5 = 3
* their parent object is `me` worth 2

Therefore the total cost is 2 + 3 = 5.

:::note
The operation definition `query` of `profile` is ignored in the calculation. This is the case even if you name your query `MY_PROFILE` like:

```
{
  profile MY_PROFILE {
    me {
      id
      user
    }
  }
}
```
:::

##### Configuration and Defaults

Defaults to a overall maxCost limit of 5000.

You can change the default value via the `costLimit` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.


```ts
{
  costLimit: {
    enabled: true,
    maxCost: 5000, // maximum cost of a request before it is rejected
    objectCost: 2, // cost of retrieving an object
    scalarCost: 1, // cost of retrieving a scalar
    depthCostFactor: 1.5, // multiplicative cost of depth
  }
}
```

#### Max Depth Limit

This protection is enabled by default.

Limit the depth of a document. Defaults to 6 levels.

Attackers often submit expensive, nested queries to abuse query depth that could overload your database or expend costly resources.

Typically, these types of unbounded, complex and expensive GraphQL queries are usually huge deeply nested and take advantage of an understanding of your schema (hence why schema introspection is disabled by default in production) and the data model relationships to create "cyclical" queries.

##### Example

An example of a cyclical query here takes advantage of knowing that an author has posts and each post has an author ... that has posts ... that has an another that ... etc.

This cyclical query has a depth of 8.

```jsx
// cyclical query example
// depth: 8+
query cyclical {
  author(id: 'jules-verne') {
    posts {
      author {
        posts {
          author {
            posts {
              author {
                ... {
                  ... # more deep nesting!
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
##### Configuration and Defaults

Defaults to 6 levels.

You can change the default value via the `maxDepth` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.

```ts
{
  maxDepth: {
    enabled: true,
    n: 6,
  }
}
```

#### Max Directives

This protections is enabled by default.

Limit the number of directives in a document. Defaults to 50.

##### Example

The following example demonstrates that by using the `@include` and `@skip` GraphQL query directives one can design a large request that requires computation, but in fact returns the expected response ...

```ts
{
  posts {
    id @include(if:true)
    id @include(if:false)
    id @include(if:false)
    id @skip(if:true)
    id @skip(if:true)
    id @skip(if:true))
    title @include(if:true)
    title @include(if:false)
    title @include(if:false)
    title @skip(if:true)
    title @skip(if:true)
    title @skip(if:true)
  }
}
```

...  of formatted Posts with just a single id and title.

```ts
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "A little more about RedwoodJS"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "What is GraphQL?"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Welcome to the RedwoodJS Community!"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "10 ways to secure your GraphQL endpoint"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

By limiting the maximum number of directives in the document, malicious queries can be rejected.

##### Configuration and Defaults

You can change the default value via the `maxDirectives` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.

```ts
{
  maxDirectives: {
    enabled: true,
    n: 50,
  }
}
```
#### Max Tokens

This protection is enabled by default.

Limit the number of GraphQL tokens in a document.

 In computer science, lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of lexical tokens.

 E.g. given the following GraphQL operation.

```ts
 graphql {
   me {
     id
     user
   }
 }
```

 The tokens are `query`, `{`, `me`, `{`, `id`, `user`, `}` and `}`. Having a total count of 8 tokens.

##### Example

Given the query with 8 tokens:

```ts
 graphql {
   me {
     id
     user
   }
 }
```

And a custom configuration to all a maximum of two tokens:

```
const armorConfig = {
  maxTokens: { n: 2 },
}
```

An error is raised:

```
'Syntax Error: Token limit of 2 exceeded, found 3.'
```

:::note

When reporting the number of found tokens, then number found is not the total tokens, but the value when found that exceeded the limit.

Therefore found would be n + 1.
:::

##### Configuration and Defaults

Defaults to 1000.

You can change the default value via the `maxTokens` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.

```ts
{
  maxTokens: {
    enabled: true,
    n: 1000,
  }
}
```
#### Block Field Suggestions

This plugin is enabled by default.

It will prevent suggesting fields in case of an erroneous request. Suggestions can lead to the leak of your schema even with disabled introspection, which can be very detrimental in case of a private API.

Example of such a suggestion:

`Cannot query field "sta" on type "Media". Did you mean "stats", "staff", or "status"?`

##### Example
##### Configuration and Defaults

Enabled by default.

You can change the default value via the `blockFieldSuggestions` setting when creating your GraphQL handler.

```ts
{
  blockFieldSuggestion: {
    enabled: true,
  }
}
```
Enabling will hide the field suggestion:

`Cannot query field "sta" on type "Media". [Suggestion hidden]?`

Orm if you want a custom mask:

```ts
{

  blockFieldSuggestion: {
    mask: '<REDACTED>'
  },
}
```

``Cannot query field "sta" on type "Media". [REDACTED]?`

### Error Masking

In many GraphQL servers, when an error is thrown, the details of that error are leaked to the outside world. The error and its message are then returned in the response and a client might reveal those errors in logs or even render the message to the user. You could potentially leak sensitive or other information about your app you don't want to share—such as database connection failures or even the presence of certain fields.

Redwood is here to help!

Redwood prevents leaking sensitive error-stack information out-of-the-box for unexpected errors.
If an error that isn't one of [Redwood's GraphQL Errors](#redwood-errors) or isn't based on a GraphQLError is thrown:

- The original error and its message will be logged using the defined GraphQL logger, so you'll know what went wrong
- A default message "Something went wrong" will replace the error message in the response (Note: you can customize this message)

#### Customizing the Error Message

But what if you still want to share an error message with client?
Simply use one of [Redwood's GraphQL Errors](#redwood-errors) and your custom message will be shared with your users.

#### Customizing the Default Error Message

You can customize the default "Something went wrong" message used when the error is masked via the `defaultError` setting on the `createGraphQLHandler`:

```tsx
export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
  loggerConfig: { logger, options: {} },
  directives,
  sdls,
  services,
  defaultError: 'Sorry about that', // 👈 Customize the error message
  onException: () => {
    // Disconnect from your database with an unhandled exception.
    db.$disconnect()
  },
})
```

#### Redwood Errors

Redwood Errors are inspired from [Apollo Server Error codes](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/#error-codes) for common use cases:

To use a Redwood Error, import each from `@redwoodjs/graphql-server`.

- `SyntaxError` - An unspecified error occurred
- `ValidationError` - Invalid input to a service
- `AuthenticationError` - Failed to authenticate
- `ForbiddenError` - Unauthorized to access
- `UserInputError` - Missing input to a service

If you use one of the errors, then the message provided will not be masked and will be shared in the GraphQL response:

```tsx
import { UserInputError } from '@redwoodjs/graphql-server'
// ...
throw new UserInputError('An email is required.')
```

then the message provided will not be masked and it will be shred in the GraphQL response.

##### Custom Errors and Uses

Need you own custom error and message?

Maybe you're integrating with a third-party api and want to handle errors from that service and also want control of how that error is shared with your user client-side.

Simply extend from `RedwoodError` and you're all set!

```tsx
export class MyCustomError extends RedwoodError {
  constructor(message: string, extensions?: Record<string, any>) {
    super(message, extensions)
  }
}
```

For example, in your service, you can create and use it to handle the error and return a friendly message:

```tsx
export class WeatherError extends RedwoodError {
  constructor(message: string, extensions?: Record<string, any>) {
    super(message, extensions)
  }
}

export const getWeather = async ({ input }: WeatherInput) {
  try {
    const weather = weatherClient.get(input.zipCode)
  } catch(error) {
    // rate limit issue
    if (error.statusCode = 429) {
      throw new WeatherError('Unable to get the latest weather updates at the moment. Please try again shortly.')
    }

    // other error
    throw new WeatherError(`We could not get the weather for ${input.zipCode}.`)
  }
}
```

#### CSRF Prevention

If you have CORS enabled, almost all requests coming from the browser will have a preflight request - however, some requests are deemed "simple" and don't make a preflight. One example of such a request is a good ol' GET request without any headers, this request can be marked as "simple" and have preflight CORS checks skipped therefore skipping the CORS check.

This attack can be mitigated by saying: "all GET requests must have a custom header set". This would force all clients to manipulate the headers of GET requests, marking them as "_not-_simple" and therefore always executing a preflight request.

You can achieve this by using the [`@graphql-yoga/plugin-csrf-prevention` GraphQL Yoga plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/csrf-prevention).

## Self-Documenting GraphQL API

RedwoodJS helps you document your GraphQL API by generating commented SDL used for GraphiQL and the GraphQL Playground explorer -- as well as can be turned into API docs using tools like [Docusaurus](#use-in-docusaurus).

If you specify the SDL generator with its `--docs` option, any comments (which the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Descriptions) calls "descriptions") will be incorporated into your RedwoodJS app's `graphql.schema` file when generating types.

If you comment your Prisma schema models, its fields, or enums, the SDL generator will use those comments as the documentation.

If there is no Prisma comment, then the SDL generator will default a comment that you can then edit.

:::note
If you re-generate the SDL, any custom comments will be overwritten.
However, if you make those edits in your Prisma schema, then those will be used.
:::

### Prisma Schema Comments

Your Prisma schema is documented with triple slash comments (`///`) that precedes:

* Model names
* Enum names
* each Model field name

```
/// A blog post.
model Post {
  /// The unique identifier of a post.
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  /// The title of a post.
  title     String
  /// The content of a post.
  body      String
  /// When the post was created.
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

/// A list of allowed colors.
enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

### SDL Comments

When used with `--docs` option, [SDL generator](cli-commands#generate-sdl) adds comments for:

* Directives
* Queries
* Mutations
* Input Types

:::note
By default, the `--docs` option to the SDL generator is false and comments are not created.
:::

Comments [enclosed in `"""` or `"`]([GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Descriptions) in your sdl files will be included in the generated GraphQL schema at the root of your project (.redwood/schema.graphql).

### Preview in GraphiQL

The [GraphQL Playground aka GraphiQL](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/features/graphiql) is a way for you to interact with your schema and try out queries and mutations. It can show you the schema by inspecting it. You can find the GraphQL Playground at [http://localhost:8911/graphql](http://localhost:8911/graphql) when your dev server is running.

The documentation generated is present when exploring the schema.

### Use in Docusaurus

If your project uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), the generated commented SDL can be used to publish documentation using the [graphql-markdown](https://graphql-markdown.github.io) plugin.

#### Basic Setup

The following is some basic setup information, but please consult [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and the [graphql-markdown](https://graphql-markdown.github.io) for latest instructions.

1. Install Docusaurus (if you have not done so already)

```terminal
npx create-docusaurus@latest docs classic
```


Add `docs` to your `workspaces` in the project's `package.json`:

```
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [
      "docs",
      "api",
      "web",
      "packages/*"
    ]
  },
```

2. Ensure a `docs` directory exists at the root of your project

```terminal
mkdir docs // if needed
```

3. Install the GraphQL Generators Plugin

```terminal
yarn workspace docs add @edno/docusaurus2-graphql-doc-generator graphql
```

4. Ensure a Directory for your GraphQL APi generated documentation resides in with the Docusaurus directory `/docs` structure

```terminal
// Change into the "docs" workspace

cd docs

// you should have the "docs" directory and within that a "graphql-api" directory
mkdir docs/graphql-api // if needed
```

5. Update `docs/docusaurus.config.js` and configure the plugin and navbar

```
// docs/docusaurus.config.js
// ...
  plugins: [
    [
      '@edno/docusaurus2-graphql-doc-generator',
      {
        schema: '../.redwood/schema.graphql',
        rootPath: './docs',
        baseURL: 'graphql-api',
        linkRoot: '../..',
      },
    ],
  ],
// ...
themeConfig:
    /** @type {import('@docusaurus/preset-classic').ThemeConfig} */
    ({
      navbar: {
        title: 'My Site',
        logo: {
          alt: 'My Site Logo',
          src: 'img/logo.svg',
        },
        items: [
          {
            to: '/docs/graphql-api', // adjust the location depending on your baseURL (see configuration)
            label: 'GraphQL API', // change the label with yours
            position: 'right',
          },
//...
```
6. Update `docs/sidebars.js` to include the generated `graphql-api/sidebar-schema.js`

```
// docs/sidebars.js
/**
 * Creating a sidebar enables you to:
 *  - create an ordered group of docs
 *  - render a sidebar for each doc of that group
 *  - provide next/previous navigation
 *
 * The sidebars can be generated from the filesystem, or explicitly defined here.
 *
 * Create as many sidebars as you want.
 */

// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs').SidebarsConfig} */
const sidebars = {
  // By default, Docusaurus generates a sidebar from the docs folder structure
  tutorialSidebar: [
    {
      type: 'autogenerated',
      dirName: '.',
    },
  ],
  ...require('./docs/graphql-api/sidebar-schema.js'),
}

module.exports = sidebars
```

7. Generate the docs

`yarn docusaurus graphql-to-doc`

:::tip
You can overwrite the generated docs and bypass the plugin's diffMethod use `--force`.

``yarn docusaurus graphql-to-doc --force`
:::

8. Start Docusaurus

```
yarn start
```

## FAQ

### Why Doesn't Redwood Use Something Like Nexus?

This might be one of our most frequently asked questions of all time. Here's [Tom's response in the forum](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/anyone-playing-around-with-nexus-js/360/5):

> We started with Nexus, but ended up pulling it out because we felt like it was too much of an abstraction over the SDL. It’s so nice being able to just read the raw SDL to see what the GraphQL API is.
